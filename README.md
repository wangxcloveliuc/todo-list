# Todo List App

A simple yet effective Todo List application built with React, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a user-friendly interface for task management, with features to add, edit, and delete tasks, while ensuring persistence through local storage.

## Objectives

- Create a user-friendly interface for task management
- Ensure tasks are saved and accessible even after a page refresh
- Provide a responsive and efficient user experience

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Input Field

- Users can type new tasks in a text input field
- Pressing 'Enter' or clicking an 'Add' button adds the task to the list
- The input field clears after adding a task

### 2. Task List

- Displays all added tasks as separate items
- Each task item includes:
  - Checkbox to mark the task as completed
  - Task description
  - 'Edit' button
  - 'Delete' button
- Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough text or different color)

### 3. Edit Functionality

- Clicking the 'Edit' button on a task allows modification of the task description
- Edit mode replaces the task description with an editable input field
- Users can save changes by clicking a 'Save' button or pressing 'Enter'
- Canceling the edit reverts the task to its original state

### 4. Delete Functionality

- Clicking the 'Delete' button on a task removes it from the list
- A confirmation dialog is displayed before deleting a task

### 5. Local Storage Integration

- Tasks are saved to local storage when added, edited, or deleted
- Upon page load, tasks are retrieved from local storage and populate the task list

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Usability

- Intuitive and easy-to-use interface
- Clear labels and tooltips for all buttons and interactive elements

### 2. Performance

- Quick loading and responsive to user inputs
- Efficient task list management to handle a reasonable number of tasks

### 3. Compatibility

- Compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive UI for various screen sizes, including mobile devices

### 4. Accessibility

- Follows web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
- Supports keyboard navigation for all functionalities

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git   cd todo-list-app

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Start the development server:

   npm start

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app

## Key Components

### `TodoInput.js`

- Handles user input for new tasks
- Implements the 'Add' button functionality

### `TodoItem.js`

- Represents a single task item in the list
- Manages checkbox, edit, and delete functionalities

### `TodoList.js`

- Manages the list of tasks
- Handles rendering of `TodoItem` components

### `useLocalStorage.js`

- Custom hook for managing local storage
- Handles saving and retrieving tasks

## State Management

- We use React's `useState` hook for managing component-level state
- The `useLocalStorage` custom hook integrates with local storage for persistence

## Testing

- Unit tests for individual components (`TodoInput`, `TodoItem`, `TodoList`)
- Integration tests to ensure the entire application works as expected
- User acceptance testing to validate the application meets user needs

Run tests using:

npm test

## Deployment

- The application can be deployed to static site hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify
- For GitHub Pages deployment:
  1. Build the project: `npm run build`
  2. Deploy to GitHub Pages: `npm run deploy`

## Future Enhancements

- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering
- Add due dates and reminders for tasks
- Implement user authentication for multi-user support
- Add categorization and tagging of tasks
